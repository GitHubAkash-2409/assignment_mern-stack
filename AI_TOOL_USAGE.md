# AI Tool Usage Statement

## Overview

This project was primarily **designed, developed, and reviewed by a me (Akash Kumar)**, with AI tools used only as a **supporting assistant**. Most of the work—including architecture decisions, debugging, testing, and validation—was completed manually.

Overall, **approximately 60–70% of the work was done by the human developer**, while **30–40% involved AI assistance** for productivity and efficiency.

---

## 1. Human Contribution (60–70%)

The following areas were handled completely through manual effort and engineering judgment:

### System Design & Architecture
- Finalized the overall system architecture (MVC pattern, folder structure, data flow)
- Selected the technology stack and development approach
- Designed backend–frontend integration strategy
- Planned refactoring and modularization of the codebase

### Core Development
- Implemented business logic and application workflows
- Integrated frontend and backend functionality
- Managed application state and data handling
- Handled edge cases and real-world usage scenarios

### Debugging & Problem Solving
- Identified and resolved runtime and logical errors
- Fixed MongoDB connection and API integration issues
- Resolved form validation and NaN-related bugs
- Corrected environment variables and port configuration issues

### Testing & Verification
- Manually tested all backend CRUD APIs
- Verified frontend rendering and responsiveness
- Tested shopping cart flows and admin dashboard functionality
- Ensured proper error handling and data consistency

### Code Review & Quality Assurance
- Reviewed and validated all AI-assisted code
- Removed unused code and unnecessary imports
- Ensured type safety and consistent naming conventions
- Improved readability, maintainability, and production readiness

---

## 2. AI Contribution (30–40%)

AI tools were used strictly as a **development assistant**, mainly to speed up repetitive or boilerplate tasks.

### Assisted Areas
- Generated initial boilerplate code (server setup, basic components)
- Suggested example CRUD API patterns
- Provided Tailwind CSS class suggestions
- Assisted with refactoring ideas and file organization
- Offered debugging hints and alternative implementation approaches

### AI Usage Boundaries
- AI-generated code was **never used directly without review**
- All suggestions were tested, modified, or rewritten manually
- Architectural and performance decisions were made solely by the developer

---

## 3. Review Process for AI-Assisted Code

All AI-assisted code went through a strict manual review process:

- Functional testing in real development environments
- Validation against project requirements
- Manual debugging and optimization
- Code cleanup and consistency checks

Only reviewed and approved code was included in the final codebase.

## Final Statement

This project represents a **human-led development process**, where AI served only as a productivity tool. The final system is the result of hands-on engineering, critical thinking, and iterative problem-solving, with AI used selectively to improve development efficiency without replacing human judgment.
